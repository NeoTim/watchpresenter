        <h1>Control with your phone</h1>
        <p>That's it! Now you can control the presentation with your phone</p>
        <p>Simply open the WatchPresenter app on your phone and use the volume buttons to control it.</p>
        <p>Just press the volume up button for next slide and volume down for the previous one.</p>
        <p>Using the volume buttons while using WatchPresenter will not modify the riger volume, so you don't have to worry about that!</p>
        <p>You can even switch the screen off if you want to save battery and avoid distractions.</p>
        <p>Once you are done, just dismiss the notification that appears on the phone to switch the app off</p>
